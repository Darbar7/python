1.What is a variable in Python, and how do you create one?

variable is container , it is used to store data/values/literals


[ ]
branch_name = "Mechanical"
2.Is it necessary to specify a data type while creating a variable in Python? Why?

No, it is not necessary to specify a data type while creating a variable in python
python is a dynamic language, it can specified data type automatically

[ ]
3.How does Python determine the data type of a variable, and can it change later?
Object `later` not found.
python automatically determines the data type of a variable
yes we can change it latter
example : - now x = 5 ---- then x = "helo"
4.What is variable reassignment, and what happens when a variable is reassigned to a different data type?

reassignment variable means "changing the value of the variable after it create"
old values of variables should be change(gone)to new one is update
example x = 10 print (x) = 10 , x = 10 x = 20 print (x) = 20
5.How can you assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line?

by using commas
using commas to unpack multiple values into variables in one line
example = a,b,c = 1, 2, "hi"
two ways to do it -
diferent values = x,y,z = "apple" , "banana" , 1 *same values = x=y=z = 10 --- all gets 10
6.Are variable names in Python case-sensitive? Explain with an example.

yes, variable names in python are case-sensitive
age = 24 ---- print(age)
Age = 24 ---- print(Age)
AGE = 24 ---- print(AGE)
7.What is an identifier in Python, and what rules must be followed while naming identifiers?

identifier is used to identify "functions,values & method" *rules ⏩ 1.Identifiers start with letters(A - Z, a - z) or underscore(_), never start with numbers(0-9) 2.Identifiers include letters,numbers (0-9) as underscore only, not with special charecters like @,#,$ 3.case-sensitive 4.connot be a python keyword like if,for,class
8.Can an identifier start with a number or contain special characters? Why?

No, identifier cannot start with numbers or special characters
must start with letters
only letters, digits nad underscore, special characters are not allowed
9.Are Python keywords allowed to be used as identifiers? Explain the reason.

No, python keywords are not allowed to be used as identifiers
keywords like if,for,while,etc... are reserved for python syntx and control structure *RESONS bold text 1.Using them as variable names causes a "syntx error"--python needs them for its own special commands 2.identifiers (variables/function names) must be unique keywords aviod confusions during code execution
10.Why is it important to use meaningful variable names and follow naming conventions in Python?

*meaningful variables names make code easy to read and understand

convention 1.improve team work 2.easier debugging & maintance
